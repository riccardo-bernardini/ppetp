* The network manager should know the {stream, user} bandwidth in
  "physical" units, say kbit/s.  When streaming root creates a new
  stream entry in the NM db, it says what is the required BW; when a
  client connects, it says what is the maximum BW that it is willing
  to spend.

* NM Syntax

    = Method POST

    = A parameter always given: command

    = Other parameters depend on the value of command

    = Available commands

        - create_stream
            Create a new entry in the NM stream DB.  It requires

	       server		  server name
               stream             stream name
               bandwidth          required BW
               profile            reduction profile
	       nonce              used in the signature 
	       signature          server signature
         
            Other parameters depend on the profile.  Every profile
            parameter has the form param-<profile name>-<param name>
            (e.g., param-vandermonde-gfsize)

	    The combination (server, stream) must be unique.  

	    Signature creation: see in the following 

       - destroy_stream
          Remove a stream form the stream DB.  It requires

               stream             stream name
	       server		  server name
	       nonce
	       signature

       - join_user
          Add a new user to the network associated to a given stream
          and sends to the user the configuration parameters. (Note:
          also the streaming root is added with this command since a
          root is a user that does not require any input stream).  It
          requires 

          Parametri necessari:
             stream                  stream name
             username                
             upload-bw               Available upload bandwidth
	     candidate-type          Currently only "ice", case insens.
             candidate               (one or more) syntax dep. on type
             n-input                 Number of required input streams
             nonce                   
	     server                  server name
             signature               server signature

	  The reason for using the signature is to be sure that the
	  request comes from the server.

	  The configuration string is the body of the reply

            * If candidate-type = ice, 'candidate' has the same syntax 
              of SDP attribute 'candidate' in ICE, that is

        foundation id transport priority address port cand-type 
          ["raddr" address] ["rport" port] *(token tonken)

       - remove_user
	   Remove a user from the DB.  Only the server can issue this
	   request. It requires

           Parametri necessari
             stream             
             username           
             nonce    
	     server    
             signature

   = I parametri sono passati come parametri del metodo GET (in realtà
   dovremmo usare POST...)

   = Forse le firme non servono se usiamo HTTP per auth

* The signature requires a key shared between the server and the NM.
  It is computed as follows: the parameter string with signature and
  nonce removed is concatenated with the key and hashed, the result is
  concatenated with the nonce and the key and hashed again, the result
  is converted in hexadecimal and used as signature.
