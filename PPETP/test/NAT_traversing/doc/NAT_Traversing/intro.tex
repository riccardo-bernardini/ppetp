For the correct functionality of the PPETP protocol every peer of the structure should be achievable. One of the most common motivation because a computer cannot be achievable is the presence of a NAT (Network Address Translator) that masquerade the real (usually private) IP address of the peer.
This document present the procedure of NAT traversing utilized by PPETP for achieve a peer behind a NAT. Not all NATs can be traversed with this procedure, it depend of the internal algorithm utilized by this device. 
The following sections briefly present the procedure that permit to traverse a NAT and then how to build a testbed to verify this functionality.
