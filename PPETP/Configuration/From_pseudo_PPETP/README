This directory holds a package with few configuration procedure
initially wrote for pseuod_PPETP (an almost dummy library PPETP-like
designed for testing purposes).  Since most of the code in the package
is PPETP-independent, it makes sense to recycle it in PPETP, but since
it will nevertheless require few changes, we put it here, out of the
way.
